# The Avanth Stone

Taking inspiration from the original *Legend of Zelda games*, the Avanth Stone will be a small 2D pixel art fantasy role-playing game in which the player is tasked with the quest of retrieving the "Avanth Stone."   

The goal for this project is to implement a variety of 2D gameplay mechanics. This will include...
* A story line that explains the game world and what the player must do.
* A basic combat system.
* At least 3 different low-level enemy types the player must battle throughout the game.
* At least one puzzle.
* At least one boss battle.

Due to its simplicity and my familiarity with the language, this game will be written in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) library.
